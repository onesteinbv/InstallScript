# [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com "Odoo's Homepage") Install Script

This script is based on the install script from Andr√© Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts)
but goes a bit further and has been improved. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a multi-odoo code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.

## Installation procedure

##### 0. Enable universe category

You have to enable universe category which contains python-pip package.
Open /etc/apt/sources.list using an editor, for example nano:

```
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

then add  universe at the end of each line, like this:

```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic main universe
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security main universe 
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-updates main universe
````
then run:

```
sudo apt update
```

There are a few things you can configure, this is the most used list:<br/>
